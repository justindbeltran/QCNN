# QCNN
Quantum Convolutional Neural Network

This library has code and pre-trained models to compare and contrast binary classification using the QCNN method and the VQC method. The pre-trained models may also be used to warm-start any current quantum classification circuits using data of the same shape. The data tested on is also provided for results verification. The various jupyter notebooks will format the data for use internally.
